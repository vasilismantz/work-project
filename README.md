## Description

This Todo list was made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react#react-----), [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui#material-ui) amongst other libraries on the frontend and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) on the backend. As for the database, I used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/2) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for hosting.

### Features

- User authentication and authorization with [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) and personally developed [authentication middleware hocs](https://github.com/vasilismantz/work-project/tree/develop/apps/www/src/hocs)
- User Password encryption using hashing with [bcrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
- Responsive design and use of [material-ui-icons](https://material-ui.com/components/material-icons/)
- Use of React [ContextAPI](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- Storage of environmental variables with [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- Detailed project development with precise and simple commit messages ([source](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/))

### Experience

- Greatly improved my skills as a backend developer by building a solid full stack application with complex entities and a simple and self exlanatory api
- Vastly imporved my css skills
- Learned more about CI/CD with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs)
- Introduced myself to the world of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- Gained more advanced React experience [ContextAPI](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- Greatly improved my development process and monitoring through the correct use of git branches, commit messages, pull requests, stashing and many more
- Got one step further to writing cleaner and more self explanatory code
